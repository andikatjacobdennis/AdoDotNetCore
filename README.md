## Prerequisites

  - [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or later installed
  - SQL Server instance (2022 or later recommended)
  - Basic knowledge of C\# and SQL
  - **For Microsoft Access connectivity:** You must install the **Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable**. Download the `accessdatabaseengine_X64.exe` installer from the official Microsoft website and install it. This provides the necessary OLE DB driver for `OleDbConnection`.

-----

## Setup

1.  Create the database and tables in SQL Server using the provided SQL script: [AdoNetTrainingDB.sql](AdoNetTrainingDB.sql)

-----

## Build and Run

From the project directory:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

-----

## Project Structure

  * `Program.cs` — The main program that demonstrates ADO.NET concepts through a console menu.
  * `AdoNetDemo.csproj` — The project file, which includes necessary NuGet package references.
  * `SampleAccessDB.accdb` — (Optional) A sample Microsoft Access database used for demonstrating OLE DB connections.
  * `people.xml` and `people.json` — (Optional) Files generated by the program to show data serialization.

## Notes

### ADO.NET Concepts

This project covers the foundational concepts of ADO.NET, a low-level, high-performance technology for data access in .NET that gives you direct control over database interactions.

#### 1\. Connected vs. Disconnected Architecture

The two primary approaches in ADO.NET are **connected** and **disconnected**.

  * **Connected Architecture:** Maintains an open connection to the database while data is being read. This approach, using objects like `SqlConnection` and `SqlDataReader`, is fast and memory-efficient for read-only, forward-only access of large datasets.
  * **Disconnected Architecture:** Fetches data into a local, in-memory **`DataSet`** and then closes the connection. The application can work with this offline data and later use a `SqlDataAdapter` to push changes back to the database. This is great for caching and working with multiple related tables.

#### 2\. Key Classes

  * **`SqlConnection`**: Manages the connection to a SQL Server database using a specified connection string.
  * **`SqlCommand`**: Represents a SQL statement or stored procedure to be executed.
  * **`SqlDataReader`**: An efficient, read-only, forward-only stream for reading rows from a database.
  * **`SqlDataAdapter`**: Acts as a bridge between the `DataSet` and the database. It fills the `DataSet` with data and pushes changes back to the database.
  * **`DataSet` and `DataTable`**: A `DataSet` is an in-memory representation of database data, acting like a lightweight database. It contains one or more `DataTable` objects, which represent individual tables.

#### 3\. Security and Best Practices

  * **Parameterized Commands**: The project demonstrates how to use **parameterized queries** to prevent **SQL injection** attacks. Instead of concatenating user input directly into a SQL string, you use placeholders (e.g., `@name`) to separate the command logic from the data.
  * **Transactions**: The code shows how to use **transactions** (`SqlTransaction`) to group multiple operations into an atomic unit. This ensures that either all operations succeed (`Commit`) or all are undone (`Rollback`), preserving data integrity.
  * **`SqlCommandBuilder`**: This utility can automatically generate the necessary `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` commands for a `DataAdapter`, which simplifies development for disconnected updates.
  * **`SqlBulkCopy`**: The fastest way to insert a large amount of data into a SQL Server table. It bypasses individual row insertions for a more efficient bulk operation.
